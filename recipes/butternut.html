    <p>The Best Butternut Squash Soup Ever is a creamy, 
        comforting bowl of pure autumn goodness. Roasted butternut squash brings out its natural sweetness, while a blend of onions,
         garlic, and a touch of spice adds depth and warmth. 
         Finished with a swirl of cream or coconut milk, this soup is velvety smooth and full of rich, nutty flavor. 
         It’s the perfect dish to cozy up with on a cool day</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>½ butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground allspice</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and thyme and sauté until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add squash and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, then cook until squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble bouillon into the soup. Season with cumin, allspice, salt, and pepper, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>2. Working in batches, pour soup into a blender, filling no more than halfway. Hold the lid in place with a kitchen towel, then carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to purée. Pour soup into a serving bowl. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and purée the soup in the pot.</li>
    </ol>
